## Problem

Panko is playing a game with **N** cards laid out in a row. The i-th card has the integer **A<sub>i</sub>** written on it.

The game is played in **N** - 1 rounds. During each round Panko will pick an adjacent pair of cards and merge them. Suppose that the cards have the integers X and Y written on them. To merge two cards, Panko creates a new card with X + Y written on it. He then removes the two original cards from the row and places the new card in their old position. Finally Panko receives X + Y points for the merge. During each round Panko will pick a pair of adjacent cards uniformly at random amongst the set of all available adjacent pairs.

After all **N** - 1 rounds, Panko's total score is the sum of points he received for each merge. What is the [expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) of Panko's total score at the end of the game?

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, **T**. **T** test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing the integer **N**. A second line follows containing **N** integers, describing the initial row of cards. The i-th integer is **A<sub>i</sub>**.

## Output

For each test case, output one line containing `Case #x: y`, where `x` is the test case number (starting from 1) and `y` is the expected total score at the end of the game.

`y` will be considered correct if it is within an absolute or relative error of 10<sup>-6</sup> of the correct answer. See the [FAQ](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart/faq#how-does-kick-start-handle-real-numbers) for an explanation of what that means, and what formats of real numbers we accept.

## Limits

1 ≤ **T** ≤ 100.<br>
1 ≤ **A<sub>i</sub>** ≤ 10<sup>9</sup> for all i.

2 ≤ **N** ≤ 9.

### Test set 2

2 ≤ **N** ≤ 100.

### Test Set 3

## Sample

| Input        | Output                |
| ------------ | --------------------- |
| 2            |                       |
| 3            | Case #1: 20.000000    |
| 2 1 10       |                       |
| 5            | Case #2: 352.33333333 |
| 19 3 78 2 31 |                       |

In sample case #1, **N** = 3. The initial row of cards is [2, 1, 10]. In the first round, Panko has two choices, of which he will choose one at random.

- If Panko merges the first pair (2, 1), then the row of cards becomes [3, 10], adding 2 + 1 = 3 points to his total score. In the second round, there is only one pair remaining (3, 10). If he merges them, the row of cards becomes [13], adding 3 + 10 = 13 points to his total score. Panko ends the game with 3 + 13 = 16 points.
- If Panko merges the second pair (1, 10), then the row of cards becomes [2, 11], adding 1 + 10 = 11 points to his total score. In the second round, there is only one pair remaining (2, 11). If he merges them, the row of cards becomes [13], adding 2 + 11 = 13 points to his total score. Panko ends the game with 11 + 13 = 24 points.

Thus, the expected number of points Panko ends the game with is (16 + 24)/2 = 20.

In sample case #2, **N** = 5. The initial row of cards is [19, 3, 78, 2, 31]. There are too many possibilities to list here, so we will only go through one possible game:

- In the first round, if Panko merges the pair (78, 2), then the row of cards becomes [19, 3, 80, 31], adding 78 + 2 = 80 to his score.
- In the second round, if Panko merges the pair (80, 31), then the row of cards becomes [19, 3, 111], adding 80 + 31 = 111 to his score.
- In the third round, if Panko merges the pair (19, 3), then the row of cards becomes [22, 111], adding 19 + 3 = 22 to his score.
- In the fourth round, if Panko merges the pair (22, 111), then the row of cards becomes [133], adding 22 + 111 = 133 to his score.

At the end of the game explained above, Panko's total score is 80 + 111 + 22 + 133 = 346.
